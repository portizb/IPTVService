## Overview

This Cordova service plugin for Android is used to obtain a RTP/UDP unicast/multicast traffic to decode and playback IPTV live channels. It forwards UDP traffic from a given multicast subscription from Movistar+ IPTV backend to the android native video player.

## Building for Android

This plugin must not depend on libraries only present in API 23+, so you __don't need build using Android SDK Platform v23 or above__. This removes the dependency on API 23 and will allow you to build against legacy API versions (22 and below). You can check the currently installed platform versions with the following command:

    cordova platform ls


## Installing

**IMPORTANT:** Note that the plugin will **NOT** work in a browser-emulated Cordova environment, for example by running `cordova serve` or using the [Ripple emulator](https://github.com/ripple-emulator/ripple).
This plugin is intended to launch **native** navigation apps and therefore will only work on native mobile platforms (i.e. Android).

### Using the Cordova CLI

#### Create the cordova project

    $ cordova create TvServices com.movistar tvservices
    
#### Install Android platform

    $ cd TvServices
    $ cordova platform add android
    
#### Install the plugin

    $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/portizb/TvServices.git
    

## Building and running

To run an example project on Android using the Cordova CLI:

### Build the code

    cordova build android
    
### Writing Plugin Tests

Edit `www/js/index.js` and add the following code inside `onDeviceReady` for test the plugin

```js
    var success = function(message) {
        alert(message);
    }

    var failure = function() {
        alert("Error calling TV Services Plugin");
    }

    tvservices.channels(success, failure);
```
### Run the code
    cordova run android
